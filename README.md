# FAAB_NIME_2020

This is code for the Feedback-Actuated Augmented Bass (FAAB) as presented at NIME2020.
The code is used on a Bela running SuperCollider. 

The file _mainPatch.scd is the current patch being used on the FAAB and requires 7 analogue controllers, four for adjusting amplitude of each string and three for blending sync, saturator and comb algorithm

The additional patches are individual algorithms, the 

Since the scaling of control signals has proven to be quite instrument-dependent, you need to do your own investigations of what works for your setup.
